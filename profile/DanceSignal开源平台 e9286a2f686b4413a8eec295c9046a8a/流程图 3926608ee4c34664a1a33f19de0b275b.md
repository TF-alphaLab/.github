## Flow Chart of Smart Health Care Open Source Project

The Smart Health Care Open Source Project aims to create a platform that provides users with a centralized location to manage their health care needs. The project will consist of several components, including a mobile app, a web app, and a back-end server.

### User Flow

1. Users will download the mobile app or access the web app to create an account and log in.
2. From the dashboard, users can access various features, such as scheduling appointments, viewing test results, and contacting their healthcare provider.
3. Users can also set reminders for medication, appointments, and other health-related activities.
4. If users need to contact their healthcare provider, they can use the messaging feature to send a secure message directly to their provider.
5. Providers can respond to messages and provide feedback or advice to users.
6. Users can also view their health history and track metrics such as blood pressure, weight, and blood sugar levels.
7. The back-end server will securely store all user data and provide access to authorized healthcare providers.

### Development Flow

1. The development team will first create wireframes and prototypes to test the user flow and gather feedback.
2. Once the prototypes have been refined, the team will begin developing the mobile and web apps simultaneously.
3. The back-end server will be developed in parallel with the apps to ensure seamless integration.
4. The team will conduct extensive testing to ensure the platform is secure and user-friendly.
5. After testing is complete, the platform will be released as open source software, allowing others to contribute to its development and improvement.
